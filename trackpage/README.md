# trackpage

Track changes on a webpage.

## Usage

```bash
$ trackpage
Checking http://www.numbertheory.org/ntw/N3.html
No changes
```

When a page has changed, the differences are shown with colors.

## Configuration

A configuration file should be created in `~/.config/trackpage/trackpage.yaml`, matching the format of the example file `trackpage.yaml`. When a CSS selector is given, only the matching elements are considered.
